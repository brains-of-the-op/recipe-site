## üöÄ Pull Request Workflow Setup Complete!

I've successfully set up a comprehensive **Pull Request preview system** for your recipe site. Here's what's now available:

### **‚úÖ What's Been Set Up:**

#### **1. GitHub Actions Workflows:**
- **`deploy.yml`** - Updated to support PR previews alongside production deployments
- **`pr-preview.yml`** - Dedicated PR preview workflow with automatic comments
- **`netlify-pr.yml`** - Alternative Netlify PR preview workflow

#### **2. PR Infrastructure:**
- **PR Template** - Guides contributors through testing calendar integration
- **Branch Protection Guide** - Instructions for setting up proper branch protection
- **Automatic PR Comments** - Preview links and testing checklists

#### **3. Testing Framework:**
- **Calendar Integration Testing** - Specific checklist for calendar features
- **Mobile Testing** - Responsive design verification
- **Cross-browser Testing** - Compatibility checks
- **Build Verification** - Ensures code quality

### **üîó How to Use PR Workflows:**

#### **For Contributors:**
1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-recipe
   ```

2. **Make changes and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new recipe"
   git push origin feature/new-recipe
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request:**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/brains-of-the-op/recipe-site/pull/new/feature/new-recipe`
   - Use the PR template
   - GitHub Actions will automatically:
     - Build your changes
     - Deploy a preview
     - Add a comment with preview link
     - Run status checks

#### **For Testing Calendar Integration:**
The PR template includes a specific checklist:
- [ ] "Plan meals & events" section appears on recipe pages
- [ ] Timeline preview shows correct prep/cook/serve phases
- [ ] Date and time picker works correctly
- [ ] Google Calendar integration opens correctly
- [ ] Apple Calendar (ICS) download works
- [ ] Timeline updates when date/time changes
- [ ] Mobile calendar buttons work properly

### **üéØ Next Steps:**

#### **1. Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended):**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/brains-of-the-op/recipe-site/settings/branches`
2. Add branch protection rule for `main`
3. Require PR reviews and status checks
4. Follow the guide in `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`

#### **2. Test the PR Workflow:**
1. **Create the test PR:** Visit the link GitHub provided:
   ```
   https://github.com/brains-of-the-op/recipe-site/pull/new/test/pr-workflow-demo
   ```
2. **Use the PR template** to test the calendar integration
3. **Verify the preview deployment** works
4. **Test calendar features** on the preview site

#### **3. Deploy to Production:**
Once you're satisfied with the PR workflow:
1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (if not already done):
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as source
2. **Your site will deploy automatically** to:
   ```
   https://brains-of-the-op.github.io/recipe-site
   ```

### **üåü Benefits of This Setup:**

- **üõ°Ô∏è Safe Testing** - Test changes before they go live
- **üöÄ Automatic Previews** - Every PR gets a preview deployment
- **üìã Guided Testing** - PR template ensures thorough testing
- **ü§ù Better Collaboration** - Easy review process with previews
- **üîç Quality Assurance** - Status checks prevent broken deployments
- **üì± Mobile Testing** - Dedicated mobile testing guidelines
