# 🎉 Meal Planner Implementation Complete!

## What Was Built

A fully functional meal planning feature has been added to your recipe site! Here's what you got:

### ✅ Core Features

1. **📅 Weekly Meal Planner Page** (`/planner`)
   - Drag-and-drop interface
   - Plan breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire week
   - Navigate between weeks
   - Auto-saves plans to browser localStorage

2. **📚 Recipe Library Sidebar**
   - Searchable recipe list
   - Filter by meal type (breakfast, main, side, dessert)
   - Shows recipe images, cooking time, and difficulty

3. **🔧 Data Conversion Script**
   - Extracts recipes from Astro's data store
   - Generates `public/recipes.json` for the planner
   - Handles all recipe metadata (times, tags, images, etc.)

4. **📝 Export Features**
   - Print weekly meal plan
   - Download shopping list as text file
   - Lists all planned recipes for easy reference

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- ✨ `tools/astro-data-to-recipes.cjs` - Conversion script
- ✨ `src/pages/planner.astro` - Meal planner page
- ✨ `public/recipes.json` - Recipe data for planner (generated)
- ✨ `docs/MEAL_PLANNER.md` - Documentation

### Modified Files
- 🔧 `src/components/Navigation.astro` - Added planner link
- 🔧 `package.json` - Added `build:recipes` script

## How to Use

### As a User

1. **Start Planning:**
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:4321/recipe-site/planner
   ```

2. **Drag Recipes:**
   - Browse recipes in the left sidebar
   - Drag any recipe onto a meal slot in the calendar
   - Drop it to assign it to that meal

3. **Navigate Weeks:**
   - Use "Previous Week" and "Next Week" buttons
   - Plans are automatically saved per week

4. **Export:**
   - Click "Print Plan" for a printable view
   - Click "Shopping List" to download recipes as a text file

### As a Developer

1. **Generate Recipe JSON:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:recipes
   ```
   This creates `public/recipes.json` from your recipe markdown files.

2. **Development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The planner will be available at `/recipe-site/planner`

3. **Production Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This now automatically runs `build:recipes` first!

## Recipe Data Format

The planner uses this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "slug": "chocolate-lava-cakes",
  "title": "Chocolate Lava Cakes",
  "href": "/recipe-site/recipes/chocolate-lava-cakes/",
  "prepTime": "10 min",
  "cookTime": "14 min",
  "totalTime": "25 min",
  "servings": "4–6 cakes",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "tags": ["dessert", "chocolate", "easy", "baked"],
  "mealType": "dessert",
  "image": "/images/recipes/lava-cakes.jpg"
}
```

## Key Features Explained

### 🎯 Smart Meal Type Inference
The script automatically categorizes recipes based on their tags and titles:
- **Breakfast**: Contains "breakfast" in tags/title
- **Dessert**: Contains "dessert", "cake", "pie", "cookie", "brownie", etc.
- **Side**: Contains "side", "vegetable", "salad", "sauce", "gravy"
- **Main**: Default for everything else

### 💾 Persistent Storage
Meal plans are saved to `localStorage` keyed by week start date:
```javascript
{
  "2025-10-13": {
    "Monday-breakfast": "brownies",
    "Tuesday-dinner": "turkey-dinner"
  }
}
```

### 🎨 Responsive Design
- Desktop: Sidebar + calendar layout
- Tablet/Mobile: Stacked layout
- Print: Optimized single-column view

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit the planner:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4321/recipe-site/planner
   ```

3. **Try these actions:**
   - Search for "chocolate"
   - Filter by "dessert"
   - Drag a recipe to Monday's breakfast
   - Navigate to next week
   - Click "Shopping List" to export

### Adding New Recipes

When you add new recipe markdown files:

1. Build once to update Astro's data store:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Or just regenerate the JSON:
   ```bash
   npm run build:recipes
   ```

The planner will automatically include new recipes!

## Customization Ideas

- **Add more meal times** (e.g., "Snack"): Edit the `MEALS` array in `planner.astro`
- **Change colors**: Update CSS variables in the `<style>` section
- **Add calorie tracking**: Extend recipe schema and update the card display
- **Smart shopping lists**: Parse recipe ingredients and aggregate them

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro + Vanilla JavaScript
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Data**: JSON (generated from Astro content collections)
- **Drag & Drop**: Native HTML5 Drag and Drop API
- **Icons**: Font Awesome

## Known Limitations

1. **First Build**: You may need to run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` once before `build:recipes` works (to generate `.astro/data-store.json`)

2. **Browser Storage Only**: Plans are saved locally; clearing browser data loses plans

3. **No Ingredient Aggregation**: Shopping list shows recipe names, not individual ingredients

These can all be enhanced in future iterations!
