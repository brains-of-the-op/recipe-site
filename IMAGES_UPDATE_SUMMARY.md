## ðŸ“‹ Recipes Still Missing Images

The following recipes don't have images because no matching image files exist:

| Recipe | Status | Action Needed |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Mashed Carrots & Swede | No image | Need to upload image to `/public/images/recipes/` |
| Half & Half Sex in a Pan | No image | Need to upload image to `/public/images/recipes/` |
| Ultimate Turkey Gravy | No image | Need to upload image to `/public/images/recipes/` |

## ðŸ“¦ Unused Images

The following images are in `/public/images/recipes/` but not yet linked to recipes:

| Image File | Potential Use |
|-----------|---------------|
| `cinnamon-buns-raspberry.jpg` | Alternative image for Cinnamon Rolls recipe (if you prefer to show the raspberry variation) |
| `chocolate-raspberry-cake.jpg` | Could be used for Sex in a Pan or saved for a future chocolate dessert recipe |

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

To complete the image implementation:

1. **Take/find photos** for the 3 recipes without images:
   - Mashed Carrots & Swede (Rutabaga)
   - Half & Half Sex in a Pan
   - Ultimate Turkey Gravy
2. **Upload images** to `/public/images/recipes/` with descriptive names like:
   - `carrot-swede-mash.jpg`
   - `sex-in-a-pan.jpg`
   - `turkey-gravy.jpg`
3. **Update recipe frontmatter** by adding the image field:
   ```markdown
   image: "/images/recipes/filename.jpg"
   ```
4. *Optional*: If you prefer to show the raspberry variation, you can update the Cinnamon Rolls recipe to use `cinnamon-buns-raspberry.jpg` instead of `cinnamon-buns.jpg`

Image guidance is available in:
- `/public/images/README.md` - Quick reference for adding images

- The site is fully set up to support images - just need to add 3 remaining photo files
