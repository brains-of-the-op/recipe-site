# 🍫🎃 Half & Half "Sex in a Pan" Plan (2 Pans, Same Base)

A decadent layered dessert that's as fun to make as it is to eat! Each pan is divided down the middle with pumpkin on one side and chocolate on the other - perfect for special occasions and crowd-pleasing.

## 🧁 Step 1 – Make Your Shared Crust (for both pans)

**Per pan:**

* 2 cups cookie/graham crumbs (240–250 g)
* ½ cup melted lactose-free butter (113 g)
* ¼ cup chopped pecans (optional)

**Directions:**

1. Mix crumbs, butter, and pecans.
2. Press into bottom of each 9×13 pan.
3. Chill for 30 min while you make fillings.
   *(This is your one universal "bottom.")*

## 🥛 Step 2 – Whip the Cream

1. Add **4 cups (950 mL)** lactose-free heavy cream + **6 Tbsp powdered sugar** + **2 tsp vanilla**.
2. Whip to soft peaks.
3. Optional: add **2 tsp instant pudding powder** to stabilize.
4. You'll end up with about **7 cups whipped cream** total.

You'll need per pan:

* 1 cup (cream cheese layer)
* 1 cup (pumpkin mix)
* 2 cups (top)
* 1 cup (chocolate pan's middle)

*(Basically, whip once — enough for both pans.)*

## 🍰 Step 3 – Cream Cheese Layer (Base for Both Sides)

**Per pan:**

* 8 oz (226 g) lactose-free cream cheese
* 1 cup powdered sugar (120 g)
* 1 cup whipped cream

1. Beat cream cheese + sugar until smooth.
2. Fold in whipped cream.
3. Spread this evenly over the entire crust (it's the base for *both* flavors).

## 🍫 Step 4 – Chocolate Half

* 1 box instant chocolate pudding (3.4 oz / 96 g)
* 1¼ cups lactose-free milk (300 mL)

1. Whisk pudding + milk for 2 minutes.
2. Let it thicken slightly.
3. On **one side of the pan**, gently spoon and spread it over half the cream-cheese layer.

## 🎃 Step 5 – Pumpkin Half

* ½ can pumpkin purée (about 200 g)
* 1 box instant pudding (vanilla or butterscotch, 3.4 oz / 96 g)
* 1 cup lactose-free milk (240 mL)
* 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
* ½ cup whipped cream

1. Whisk pudding mix, milk, pumpkin, and spice for 2 minutes.
2. Fold in whipped cream.
3. Spread over the *other* half of the pan.

💡 **Tip:**
Use a strip of parchment, foil, or even a spatula edge to "wall" between sides while spreading — then lift it once both halves are smoothed out.

## 🍦 Step 6 – Top It All

* Spread **2 cups whipped cream** evenly across the *entire pan*.
* Dust the chocolate side with cocoa or chocolate shavings.
* Sprinkle the pumpkin side with cinnamon or crushed pecans.

## ❄️ Step 7 – Chill & Serve

* Chill **at least 6 hours**, overnight best.
* Each pan yields **12–16 squares** (each square has both sides — perfection).
* Keep cold until serving.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* **Make each pan in parallel** — it's easier than trying to do one *giant* batch.
* **Chill both pans overnight** if possible for the best texture.
* **One batch of this recipe** already fills a 9x13 pan quite thickly, so don't try to cram both into a single larger dish.
* **Use warm (not hot)** water for the cornstarch slurry to prevent clumps.
* **Low simmer** is your friend — keeps gravy smooth and rich.
