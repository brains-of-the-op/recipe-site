## 🔪 Instructions

### Step 1: Marinate (Optional but Recommended)
Mix pork strips with **1 tbsp olive oil**, **garlic**, **lime juice**, and all **spices**.  
Let sit for at least **20 minutes** (or up to **2 hours** in the fridge).

### Step 2: Cook the Pork
Heat a large skillet over **medium-high heat**.  
Add the pork and cook **4–6 minutes** until browned and just cooked through.  
Remove from pan and set aside.

### Step 3: Cook the Veggies
In the same pan, add **1 tbsp olive oil**.  
Add sliced **onions** and **peppers**, cooking **5–7 minutes** until softened and slightly charred.

### Step 4: Combine
Return pork to the pan with veggies.  
Toss everything together and adjust seasoning to taste.

### Step 5: Warm the Tortillas
Warm tortillas in a dry skillet or directly over a gas flame until soft and slightly charred.

### Step 6: Assemble
Spoon the pork and veggie mixture into tortillas.  
Top with **sour cream**, **guacamole**, **salsa**, **cheese**, or **cilantro** as desired.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* For a **smoky, restaurant-style flavor**, use a **cast iron skillet** and let the edges get a bit charred.  
* Slice veggies evenly so they cook at the same rate.  
* Marinating overnight adds deeper flavor.  
* Use leftovers in rice bowls, quesadillas, or salads.

## 🍳 Cooking Notes

* Works great with **chicken** or **steak strips** too.  
* Swap tortillas for lettuce wraps for a lighter version.  
* Serve with lime wedges and hot sauce on the side.
