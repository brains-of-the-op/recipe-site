# Chocolate Raspberry Cake

Rich, moist chocolate cake layered with tart raspberry filling, silky chocolate buttercream, and a glossy chocolate raspberry ganache. This show-stopping cake is perfect for birthdays, Valentine’s Day, or any celebration where chocolate lovers gather.

## 🧂 Ingredients

### Raspberry Filling
* 1½ Tbsp (22ml) water  
* 1½ Tbsp (12g) cornstarch  
* 3 cups (12 oz / 340–375g) fresh or frozen raspberries *(do not thaw)*  
* ⅓ cup (67g) granulated sugar  
* 1 tsp lemon juice  
* ½ tsp pure vanilla extract  

### Chocolate Cake
**Dry Ingredients**
* 1¾ cups (219g) all-purpose flour, spooned & leveled  
* ¾ cup (62g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder  
* 1¾ cups (350g) granulated sugar  
* 2 tsp baking soda (12g)  
* 1 tsp baking powder (4g)  
* 1 tsp salt  
* 2 tsp espresso powder *(optional)*  

**Wet Ingredients**
* ½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil or melted coconut oil  
* 2 large eggs, room temperature (65°F / 18°C)  
* ¾ cup (180g) full-fat sour cream, room temperature  
* ½ cup (120ml) buttermilk, room temperature  
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract  
* ½ cup (120ml) hot water or black coffee  
* 1 cup (170g) mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, tossed in 1 Tbsp flour  

### Chocolate Buttercream
* 1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature  
* 3½ cups (420g) confectioners’ sugar *(or 400g for smoother, lighter flavor)*  
* ½ cup (41g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch-process)  
* 3 Tbsp (45ml) heavy cream or milk  
* ⅛ tsp salt  
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract  

### Chocolate Raspberry Ganache
* 8 oz (226g) quality semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped  
  * *Note:* 6 oz works well and still yields plenty of ganache; could reduce to 5 oz next time.  
* ¾ cup (180ml) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream  
* ¼ cup (60ml) raspberry liqueur (e.g., Chambord) — or replace with extra cream  
* Optional garnish: fresh raspberries and mint leaves

## 🔪 Instructions

### Step 1: Raspberry Filling
1. Whisk cornstarch and water until dissolved.  
2. In a medium saucepan, combine cornstarch mixture, raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice.  
3. Stir and mash raspberries as they soften; bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  
4. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla.  
5. Cool 10–15 minutes, then transfer to a bowl and refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (up to 1 week).  
   - *May 4, 2025:* Strained filling—next time use 450–500g raspberries for more yield.  
   - *July 1, 2025:* Doubled batch; strained with filter bag (not cheesecloth); added ¼ of seeds back for texture—perfect balance.  
6. Cover if chilling longer than 4 hours; filling thickens as it chills.

### Step 2: Make the Cake
1. Preheat oven to **350°F (177°C)**.  
2. Grease three 8- or 9-inch cake pans and line with parchment rounds.  
3. In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients: flour, cocoa, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, espresso powder.  
4. In a separate bowl or mixer, combine oil, eggs, and sour cream on medium-high speed until smooth.  
5. Add buttermilk and vanilla; mix to combine.  
6. Pour wet ingredients into dry and add hot water (or coffee).  
7. Mix on low speed until smooth; fold in chocolate chips (optional). Batter will be thin—about 6 to 6½ cups total (~1400g).  
8. Divide evenly among 3 pans (approx. 410–425g each).  
9. Bake **24–26 minutes** (up to 29 if needed).  
   - *Jan 20, 2024:* 29 min, great texture.  
   - *Feb 13, 2024:* 28 min, slightly better.  
   - *May 3, 2025:* 28 min slightly overdone → try 26–27 min.  
   - *July 1, 2025:* 26 min → internal 200°F, clean toothpick, perfect result.  
10. Cool completely in pans on wire racks. Slight sinking in centers is normal.

### Step 3: Chocolate Buttercream
1. Beat butter on medium speed until creamy (about 2 min).  
2. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa, cream/milk, salt, and vanilla.  
3. Beat on low 30 sec, then on high 1 min until fluffy.  
   - *Feb 14, 2024:* Used 400g sugar—improved consistency and taste.  
4. Use this buttercream for a thin layer under raspberry filling, to pipe “dams” between layers, and as a crumb coat (makes ~2.5 cups total).

### Step 4: Assemble the Cake
1. Place first cake layer on serving plate.  
2. Spread ~¼ cup buttercream over top.  
3. Pipe a thick border (“dam”) of buttercream around edge.  
4. Spread ½ of chilled raspberry filling inside the border.  
5. Repeat with second layer: buttercream, dam, raspberry filling.  
6. Place final layer on top.  
7. Apply crumb coat: spread thin layer of buttercream over entire cake.  
8. Smooth with bench scraper and chill uncovered **30 minutes–3 hours**.

### Step 5: Chocolate Raspberry Ganache
1. Place chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl.  
2. In a saucepan, heat cream and liqueur until gently simmering (not boiling).  
3. Pour over chocolate; let sit 2–3 minutes.  
4. Stir slowly until smooth.  
5. Chill **30 minutes** until thickened before spreading.  
   - *Feb 14, 2024:* Used only 6 oz chocolate, ¾ cup cream — still had plenty. Success!  

---

### Step 6: Final Assembly
1. Pour or spoon thickened ganache over chilled cake.  
2. Spread evenly with spatula.  
3. Garnish with fresh raspberries and mint if desired.  
4. Chill uncovered up to 6 hours before serving, or serve immediately.  
5. Store leftovers covered in the fridge up to 5 days.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* For deeper flavor, use black coffee instead of hot water in batter.  
* Strain raspberry filling partially—keeping ~¼ seeds adds texture.  
* Chill all components fully before layering for best structure.  
* Cake can be served chilled or room temp.  
* Ideal internal cake temperature: ~200°F when done.

## 🍳 Cooking Notes

* Raspberry filling keeps up to 1 week in fridge or 3 months frozen.  
* Cake layers can be baked 1 day ahead; wrap tightly and refrigerate.  
* Assemble up to 1 day before serving; store covered and chilled.  
* Makes an elegant celebration cake with rich chocolate and tangy fruit balance.
