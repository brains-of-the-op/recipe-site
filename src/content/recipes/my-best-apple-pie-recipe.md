# My Best Apple Pie Recipe

With a mountain of gooey, cinnamon-kissed apples nestled under a perfectly buttery and flaky pie crust, this is the ultimate homemade apple pie. The secret to perfect texture and flavor is a quick 5-minute pre-cook of the filling—just enough to soften the apples and deepen the taste. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for the coziest homestyle dessert.

## 🧂 Ingredients

* **Pie Crust:** Homemade Pie Crust or All-Butter Pie Crust (each makes 2 crusts, for bottom and top)  
* 10 cups (1250g) apples, peeled, cored, and sliced ¼-inch thick (about 8 large apples)  
* ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar (or packed brown sugar)  
* ¼ cup (31g) all-purpose flour, spooned & leveled  
* 1 Tbsp (15ml) lemon juice  
* 1½ tsp ground cinnamon  
* ¼ tsp each ground allspice & nutmeg  
* **Egg wash:** 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tbsp (15ml) milk  
* Optional: coarse sugar for crust topping

## 🔪 Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Crust
1. Prepare your pie dough through Step 5 of your chosen crust recipe (Homemade or All-Butter). Chill as directed.

### Step 2: Make the Filling
1. In a large bowl, mix apple slices, sugar, flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg until evenly coated.  
2. *(Optional but recommended)*: Pour the filling into a large skillet or Dutch oven. Cook over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until apples just begin to soften. Remove from heat and set aside.

### Step 3: Assemble the Pie
1. Preheat oven to **400°F (204°C)**.  
2. On a floured surface, roll out one disc of chilled dough to a 12-inch circle. Fit it into a 9-inch pie dish (1.5–2 inches deep). Smooth it into the corners.  
3. Spoon filling into crust—pile it high and tight; it will bake down.  
4. Roll out the second disc of dough to a 12-inch circle. Cut 1-inch strips with a pastry wheel or knife.  
5. Weave strips over the pie to form a lattice top. Trim excess dough and fold edges inward to seal. Crimp or flute edges.

### Step 4: Bake
1. Brush the top with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse sugar, if using.  
2. Place pie on a baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes.  
3. Without removing the pie, lower oven to **375°F (190°C)**. Add a pie crust shield to protect the edges.  
4. Continue baking for 35–40 minutes more, until filling is bubbling and crust is golden brown.  
   - Filling should reach **195°F (90°C)** internally for best texture.  
5. If crust browns too quickly, tent foil loosely over top.

### Step 5: Cool & Serve
1. Transfer pie to a cooling rack and cool at least **3 hours** before slicing.  
2. Serve with ice cream or whipped cream.  
3. Cover leftovers and store at room temperature up to 1 day or in fridge up to 5 days.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* **Apple Variety:** Combine tart and sweet apples (e.g. 4 Granny Smith + 4 Honeycrisp or Pink Lady).  
* **Juicier Filling:** Optional 5-minute pre-cook draws out natural juices and enhances flavor.  
* **Internal Temperature:** Bake until filling reaches 195°F for fully cooked fruit and thickened starch.  
* **Crust Shield Tip:** Use a homemade foil shield to prevent over-browning (see below).  
* **Cooling Time:** Essential—pie needs 3 hours to set properly before slicing.

## 🍳 Cooking Notes

* **Make Ahead / Freeze:**  
  - Make 1 day ahead: cool completely, cover tightly, and keep at room temperature.  
  - Unbaked crust dough keeps 5 days refrigerated or 3 months frozen.  
  - Baked pie freezes up to 3 months; thaw overnight before serving.  
  - Prepared filling can also be frozen up to 3 months (thaw overnight in fridge before using).  
* **Homemade Pie Shield:** Cut a 14-inch square of foil, fold in half, and remove a 5-inch semi-circle. Unfold and fit over crust edges to shield.  
* **Hand Pies Option:** Use this same filling to make apple hand pies!  
* **Special Tools:** Apple Peeler, Glass Mixing Bowl, Skillet or Dutch Oven, Rolling Pin, Pie Dish, Pastry Wheel, Kitchen Shears, Baking Sheet, Thermometer.

### Experiment Log

- **Sep 13, 2025:** Made 1x for Simon’s birthday BBQ  
  - Used 2” glass pie dish.  
  - Thawed frozen filling 24h in fridge; brought to room temp 1h before baking.  
  - Tried reducing gap between top and bottom crust; trimmed too far → not enough overlap = liquid leakage.  
  - Frozen filling layered perfectly from vacuum bag—great structure.  
  - Next time: layer apples manually, redistributing reserved liquid between layers for more even bake.  
  - Bake: 400°F 25m → 375°F 50m; final temp 195°F. Excellent flavor and feedback—experiment success!
