## 🔪 Instructions

### Step 1: Bake the Tots
1. Preheat oven to **425°F (220°C)**.  
2. Arrange tater tots in a single layer on a large sheet pan.  
3. Bake **25–30 minutes**, flipping halfway, until crispy and golden.

### Step 2: Prepare the Toppings
1. Warm taco beef and shred cheese.  
2. Slice onions and cook in butter/oil over medium heat:  
   - **Quick sauté:** 5–7 min until soft and golden; add Worcestershire or balsamic if desired.  
   - **Caramelized:** 15–20 min on low for deeper flavor.  
3. Warm roast beef slightly.

### Step 3: Assemble
1. Remove tots and divide the pan roughly in half.  
2. **Taco Side:** Add taco beef and top with shredded cheese.  
3. **Roast Beef Side:** Layer roast beef, onions, cheddar, then dollop Boursin evenly.

### Step 4: Broil to Melt
1. Switch oven to **broil**.  
2. Broil **3–5 minutes**, just until cheese is melted and bubbling. Watch closely!

### Step 5: Finish & Serve
1. **Taco Side:** Add salsa, sour cream, and cold toppings.  
2. **Roast Beef Side:** Drizzle with creamy horseradish or enjoy as is.  
3. Serve family-style right from the sheet pan.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* Mix and match toppings — the “half & half” concept works with any combo (BBQ chicken, buffalo ranch, veggie supreme, etc.).  
* For extra crunch, use an air fryer to re-crisp leftovers.  
* Reheat in a skillet or oven instead of microwave for best texture.

* Perfect for casual dinners, potlucks, or game-day spreads.
