# ðŸ¥£ Ultimate Turkey Gravy (From Pan Drippings)

Perfect â€” gravy is the glue that makes the whole turkey dinner *sing*. Rich, silky, and balanced gravy that uses all those glorious pan drippings from your roasted turkey.

## ðŸ§º Ingredients

* **Pan drippings** from roasted turkey (fat + juices)
* **2â€“3 tbsp cornstarch** (or flour if you prefer a classic roux)
* **Â½ cup warm water** (for slurry)
* **1â€“2 packs Club House Turkey gravy seasoning**
* **2â€“3 packs OXO** (chicken or turkey flavor)
* **1 cup water** (add as needed for consistency)
* **Salt & pepper**, to taste
* *(Optional)* Â½ tsp **poultry seasoning** or **sage** for depth
* *(Optional)* 1 tbsp **butter** for finishing sheen

## ðŸ”¥ Step-by-Step

### 1. Collect the Gold

After the turkey is done and resting:

* Pour **all pan juices** into a **heatproof container** or **fat separator**.
* Let sit a minute for the fat to rise.
* Skim off most of the fat (save ~2 tbsp if you want that rich flavor).
* Leave all the **brown bits (fond)** in the roasting pan â€” they're pure flavor.

### 2. Deglaze the Pan

* Place roasting pan directly over **medium-high heat** on the stovetop.
* Add a splash of **water or stock** and **scrape** up every browned bit with a wooden spoon.
* Once simmering, pour back in your skimmed pan juices.

### 3. Make the Slurry

* In a shaker or small bowl, **mix 2â€“3 tbsp cornstarch** with **Â½ cup warm (not hot) water**.
* Shake/stir until smooth and no lumps remain.

### 4. Thicken the Gravy

* Bring the liquid in the pan to a **low boil**.
* Slowly whisk in the cornstarch slurry.
* Continue stirring until thickened (2â€“4 minutes).
* Adjust consistency:

  * Too thin â†’ add a bit more slurry.
  * Too thick â†’ whisk in more water or stock.

### 5. Season Like a Pro

* Whisk in:

  * **1â€“2 packs Club House Turkey gravy mix**
  * **2â€“3 packs OXO**, dissolved in warm water
  * **Salt & pepper** to taste
  * *(Optional)* pinch of **poultry seasoning or sage**
* Let it **low-simmer** for 3â€“5 minutes, stirring often.

### 6. Finish & Strain

* Once smooth and glossy, remove from heat.
* Stir in **1 tbsp butter** for shine.
* **Strain through a fine mesh sieve** into gravy boats for that silky restaurant finish.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

* Use **warm (not hot)** water for the cornstarch slurry to prevent clumps.
* **Low simmer** is your friend â€” keeps gravy smooth and rich.
* Don't rush the straining step â€” it makes all the difference.
* You can make gravy up to **an hour ahead**; keep warm over low heat or in a thermos-style carafe.

## ðŸ§‚ Fixing Salty Gravy

If your gravy comes out too salty, here are quick fixes:

### 1. **Dilute and Rebalance**

**If it's just mildly salty:**

* Add **unsalted liquid** â€” like:

  * Warm **water**
  * **Unsalted or low-sodium stock**
  * A splash of **milk or cream** (for a richer finish)
* Start with **Â¼ cup at a time**, whisk in, and taste.
* Then thicken again if needed (add a little more cornstarch slurry).

### 2. **The Potato Trick**

* Drop a **peeled raw potato** (cut in half or large chunks) into the simmering gravy.
* Simmer **10â€“15 minutes** â€” it will absorb salt.
* Remove and discard before serving.

### 3. **Add Unsalted Fat or Dairy**

Salt clings to fat, so:

* Stir in **a tablespoon of unsalted butter** or **a splash of cream**.
* This smooths flavor and softens the salt edge.
* You can also whisk in **a spoonful of mashed potatoes** if you've got them ready â€” great thickener + salt buffer.

### 4. **Introduce a Flavor Contrast**

For deeper or more complex gravy, balance the salt with:

* **Â½â€“1 tsp vinegar** (balsamic, apple cider, or white wine)
* OR **Â½â€“1 tsp lemon juice**
* OR **a pinch of sugar or maple syrup**

> ðŸª„ *Tiny amounts* only â€” you're restoring balance, not turning it sweet or sour.

## ðŸ§  Pro Tip for Next Time

OXO packs and Clubhouse gravy mix both bring salt â€” next round, try:

* Use **half OXO** at first, taste before adding more.
* Always **reduce the pan drippings** before seasoning â€” it concentrates salt.
* Keep **unsalted stock** handy for adjustments during thickening.
