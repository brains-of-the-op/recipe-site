## 🔪 Instructions

### Step 1: Cook the Beef
1. In a skillet over medium heat, sauté onions and garlic until soft (about 3 minutes).  
2. Add ground beef and cook until browned and crumbled.  
3. Stir in chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper.  
4. Mix in tomato paste and water or broth. Simmer 5–7 minutes until thickened and saucy.

### Step 2: Make the Slaw
1. Toss cabbage with lime juice, sour cream, honey, and a pinch of salt.  
2. Chill in the fridge while the beef finishes cooking to allow flavors to meld.

### Step 3: Assemble & Fry Tacos
1. Warm tortillas slightly so they’re pliable.  
2. Spoon in a layer of beef and sprinkle of cheese; fold in half.  
3. Heat oil (about 2 Tbsp) in skillet over medium heat.  
4. Fry each taco 2–3 minutes per side, until golden and crispy.  
5. Drain briefly on paper towels.

### Step 4: Garnish & Serve
1. Top with lime slaw, sour cream, and herbs if desired.  
2. Serve with lime wedges and salsa or hot sauce.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* Use a nonstick skillet for easier taco flipping.  
* For less oil, bake at 425°F for 8–10 min per side instead of frying.  
* Slaw can be made a day ahead — just refresh with a squeeze of lime before serving.

## 🍳 Cooking Notes

* Store leftover tacos unassembled; reheat beef separately and crisp tortillas fresh.  
* Pairs perfectly with Mexican rice, refried beans, or a simple green salad.  
* Substitute ground turkey or chicken for a lighter twist.
