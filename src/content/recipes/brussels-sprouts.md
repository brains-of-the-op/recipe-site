# 🥓 Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Bacon

Excellent — now we're talking! 🥓🔥 Let's go full flavor: crispy roasted **Brussels sprouts with bacon**, perfectly balanced with a little sweetness, acid, and a touch of salt to complement your rich turkey and gravy.

## 🧺 Ingredients

* **2 lbs Brussels sprouts**, trimmed and halved
* **6–8 slices thick-cut bacon**, chopped (or about ½ lb)
* **3 tbsp olive oil** (or bacon fat for extra flavor)
* **½ tsp salt**
* **¼ tsp black pepper**
* **1 tbsp maple syrup** *(optional but killer)*
* **1 tbsp balsamic vinegar** *(for brightness)*
* **1 tbsp butter** *(to finish, optional)*

### 🔥 Optional add-ons:

* ¼ cup **toasted pecans or walnuts**
* ¼ cup **dried cranberries**
* A sprinkle of **Parmesan** or **feta** at the end

## 🔪 Prep

1. **Preheat oven** to **400°F (200°C)**.
2. **Trim Brussels sprouts**: Cut off tough ends, halve lengthwise.
3. **Spread bacon** pieces on a **large sheet pan** (lined with parchment for easy cleanup).
4. **Roast bacon** for **8–10 minutes**, until starting to crisp and render fat.

## 🍳 Roast the Sprouts

1. **Add Brussels sprouts** to the sheet pan with the bacon (toss in rendered fat).

   * If pan is too crowded, split between two pans for even roasting.
2. **Drizzle with olive oil**, **salt**, and **pepper**. Toss to coat well.
3. **Roast 20–25 minutes**, flipping halfway, until:

   * Outer leaves are dark golden and crisp
   * Centers are tender but not mushy

## 🍯 Finish Like a Pro

1. In the last **5 minutes**, drizzle with **maple syrup** and **balsamic vinegar**. Toss gently to glaze.
2. Optional: Toss in **butter** and swirl for shine and richness.
3. Sprinkle with **toasted nuts** or **cranberries** if using.
4. Serve hot — ideally straight from the pan.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* **Render first, roast second**: Starting the bacon before the sprouts = crispy bits and built-in flavor.
* **Crowding kills crisp** — use two pans if needed.
* **Balance** is key: The balsamic + maple combo cuts the turkey's richness beautifully.
* For extra smoky depth, finish with a **dash of smoked paprika** or a **squeeze of lemon**.
