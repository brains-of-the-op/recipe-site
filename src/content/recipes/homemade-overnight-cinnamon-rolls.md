## 🔪 Instructions

### Step 1: Preparation (Day 1)
1. Bring butter and eggs to room temperature.
2. Optional: If making OG filling, also soften another ½ cup butter.
3. Grease a 9×13-inch baking dish (or two 9-inch pie tins for half-batches).

### Step 2: Make the Dough
1. In a stand mixer with dough hook or paddle, whisk together:
   - Warm milk  
   - 2 Tbsp sugar  
   - Yeast  
2. Let sit 5 minutes until foamy.
3. Beat in remaining sugar and butter on medium speed until roughly combined.
4. Add eggs and salt; mix until incorporated.  
   *Note: butter may remain in small pieces—this is normal.*
5. Reduce speed to low; add flour 1 cup at a time. Mix until dough forms and pulls from sides (~3 min).
6. Switch to dough hook (if not already) and knead for 5 minutes, or knead by hand for 5 minutes, until soft and slightly tacky.  
   *Tip: Dough passes the “windowpane test” when ready.*
7. **1st Rise:** Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and rise in a warm spot until doubled in size (~2 hours).

### Step 3: Shape the Rolls
1. Punch down dough to release air.
2. Roll out on a floured surface to a 12×18-inch rectangle (or 12×36 for double batch).
3. Spread softened butter evenly over the dough.  
4. Mix sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle evenly across the surface.  
   *For other fillings, use raspberry or lemon mixtures instead.*
5. Roll tightly into a log and cut into 12 rolls (~1.5-inch thick).  
6. Arrange rolls in prepared pan(s).

### Step 4: 2nd Rise
* **Same-day:** Cover and let rise 1 hour until puffy.  
* **Overnight option:** Cover tightly and refrigerate 8–12 hours (max 16). Let sit 1–2 hours at room temp before baking.

### Step 5: Bake
1. Preheat oven to **350°F (177°C)**.
2. Bake 25–28 minutes until golden on top and internal temp is 190–200°F (88–93°C).
   - Tent with foil halfway through to prevent over-browning.  
   - Baking times vary by pan type and filling (see notes below).
3. Let cool 10 minutes on a wire rack.

### Step 6: Make the Icing
1. Beat softened cream cheese until smooth.  
2. Add sugar, cream/milk (or lemon juice for lemon icing), and vanilla.  
3. Beat on low 30 sec, then on high 1 min until fluffy.  
4. Spread over warm rolls and serve immediately.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* **Testing Notes:**  
  - *Feb 17, 2025:* Pulling tighter during roll-up created denser buns; avoid tightening to retain fluffiness.  
  - *Jan 21 & Feb 17, 2025:* Pyrex 9×13 required ~36 min at 350°F to reach 195°F internally.  
  - *Jun 1, 2025:* Same setup; 36 min → 196°F perfect texture.  
* **Flour note:** Start with 4 cups, then add remaining ½ cup gradually.  
* **Kneading note:** 5 minutes with dough hook gives ideal texture.  
* **Filling variation:** Roll different flavors separately for best structure.  
* **Rise environment:** A warm kitchen (~75°F) speeds up the first rise.

## 🍳 Cooking Notes

* Make Ahead (Overnight): Follow through Step 5, then refrigerate up to 16 hours. Bring to room temp 1–2 hours before baking.  
* Freezing (Baked): Freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in fridge, reheat before serving.  
* Freezing (Unbaked): Par-bake 10 minutes, cool, freeze. Thaw overnight, finish baking 15–20 minutes.  
* **Baking temperature testing:** Internal temp between 190–200°F ensures soft, cooked dough.  
* Works well with both metal and glass pans (metal browns faster).  
* Perfect for weekend brunch, holidays, or as a prep-ahead treat.
