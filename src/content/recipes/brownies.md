# Chewy Brownies

Rich, chewy brownies with a crackly top and fudgy center — perfect for chocolate lovers! Whisking eggs and sugar thoroughly gives that shiny top, while gentle folding keeps the texture dense and chewy.

## 🧂 Ingredients

- **Butter**: 5 tbsp (70g), melted  
- **Sugar**: 1¼ cups (250g) granulated  
- **Eggs**: 2 large + 1 egg yolk  
- **Vanilla**: 1 tsp  
- **Oil**: ⅓ cup (80ml) vegetable oil  
- **Cocoa powder**: ¾ cup (75g)  
- **Flour**: ½ cup (60g)  
- **Cornstarch**: 1 tbsp (8g)  
- **Salt**: ¼ tsp  
- **Chocolate chips**: ¾ cup (130g)

## 🔪 Instructions

### Step 1: Prep
1. Preheat oven to **325°F (163°C)**.  
2. Line an 8x8-inch pan with parchment paper.

### Step 2: Wet Ingredients
1. Whisk melted butter and sugar until smooth.  
2. Add eggs, egg yolk, vanilla, and oil; whisk until fully combined.

### Step 3: Dry Ingredients
1. Sift cocoa powder, flour, cornstarch, and salt into the wet mixture.  
2. Fold gently until just combined (don’t overmix).

### Step 4: Add & Bake
1. Stir in chocolate chips.  
2. Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.  
3. Bake for **28–35 minutes**, until a toothpick comes out with moist crumbs.

### Step 5: Cool & Slice
1. Let brownies cool completely in the pan before slicing for clean cuts.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* **Crackly Top**: Whisk eggs and sugar thoroughly to create the signature glossy top.  
* **Chewy Texture**: Avoid overmixing after adding dry ingredients.  
* **Optional Chill**: Refrigerate the batter for 1–2 hours before baking for firmer brownies.  
* **Storage**: Keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 3–4 days or freeze up to 3 months.

## 🍳 Cooking Notes

* Great with ice cream or a sprinkle of sea salt.  
* Doubles easily for a 9x13-inch pan (increase bake time slightly).  
* Works as a base for brownie sundaes or ice cream sandwiches.
