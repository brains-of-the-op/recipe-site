# 🥕 Mashed Carrots & Swede (Rutabaga)

Ahhh, *carrots and Swede* — the humble root duo that always steals a little spotlight from the turkey. 🥕✨ The sweetness of carrots meets the buttery, nutty flavor of Swede (or rutabaga for my North American friends), and together they make a **creamy, comforting, perfectly golden mash** that's a turkey dinner classic.

## 🧂 Ingredients

* 1 medium **Swede (rutabaga)** (~1.5–2 lb)
* 5–6 large **carrots**
* ½–¾ cup **butter** (start with ½, add more to taste)
* **Salt & pepper**, to taste
* 1–2 tbsp **heavy cream or milk** *(optional for creamier mash)*

### Optional flavor enhancers:

* 1 tsp **fresh thyme leaves** or ½ tsp dried
* ½ tsp **nutmeg** or **ground allspice** (for warm flavor)
* 1 tbsp **honey** or **maple syrup** if you like it a little sweet
* 1 tbsp **chopped parsley** for garnish

## 🔪 Instructions

### 1️⃣ Prep the Roots

* Peel the **Swede** (use a sharp knife — the skin is thick) and **carrots**.
* Chop both into evenly sized cubes (~1 inch).
  *(Swede takes a little longer to cook, so if you want perfect timing, cut Swede pieces slightly smaller than the carrot ones.)*

### 2️⃣ Boil Until Tender

* Add carrots and rutabaga to a large pot.
* Cover with cold water, add **1 tbsp salt**, and bring to a boil.
* Reduce to a simmer and cook **30–40 minutes**, until both are fork-tender.

  * Swede will be the slowest to soften — check it first.

### 3️⃣ Drain & Steam Dry

* Drain in a colander, then return to the warm pot.
* Let sit uncovered for 2–3 minutes to let excess moisture evaporate (this helps the mash stay rich, not watery).

### 4️⃣ Mash & Season

* Add **butter**, **salt**, and **pepper** right away — the heat will melt everything together.
* Mash by hand for a rustic texture or use a hand mixer for smoother results.
* Optional: Stir in a splash of **cream** or **milk** for silkiness.
* Taste and adjust seasoning.

### 5️⃣ Flavor Options (Choose Your Style)

**Classic:**
→ Just butter, salt, pepper, maybe a touch of nutmeg.

**Herbed:**
→ Add fresh thyme leaves and a sprinkle of chopped parsley before serving.

**Sweet & Savory:**
→ Stir in 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup + ½ tsp allspice or nutmeg for a gentle sweetness that pairs *beautifully* with turkey and gravy.

### 6️⃣ Serve & Hold Warm

* Transfer to serving bowl.
* Garnish with a little pat of butter and herbs.
* If serving later: cover with foil and keep warm in a low oven (around 200°F / 95°C) or in a covered pot over low heat.

## 🕓 Timing Tip for Turkey Day

Start this around the **last hour of turkey roasting**:

* While the turkey finishes its final baste and browning, get your carrots and Swede boiling.
* By the time the bird is resting, your mash will be ready to go.
* They hold heat *extremely* well — perfect for a make-ahead side.
