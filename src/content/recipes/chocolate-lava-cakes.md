# Chocolate Lava Cakes

Decadent individual chocolate lava cakes with a rich, molten chocolate center — made with just 6 ingredients and ready in 25 minutes. These elegant little cakes always impress but are surprisingly simple to make. If you don’t have ramekins, you can also use a muffin pan.

## 🧂 Ingredients

* 6 oz (170g) high-quality semi-sweet chocolate *(use baking bars like Baker’s, Ghirardelli, or Lindt)*  
* ½ cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter  
* ¼ cup (31g) all-purpose flour, spooned & leveled  
* ½ cup (60g) confectioners’ sugar  
* ⅛ tsp salt  
* 2 large eggs  
* 2 large egg yolks  
* Optional toppings: ice cream, berries, and/or chocolate syrup  

## 🛠️ Tools

* 4 ramekins (6 oz each)  
* 2 small mixing bowls  
* 1 medium mixing bowl  
* Baking sheet  

## 🔪 Instructions

### Step 1: Preparation
1. Remove eggs from the fridge and separate yolks from half of them.
2. Spray four 6-ounce ramekins with nonstick spray or butter, then dust with cocoa powder.  
   *Alternative:* spray half of a 12-count muffin pan and dust with cocoa powder (yields 6 cakes).  
3. Preheat oven to **425°F (218°C)**.  
4. Coarsely chop the chocolate.

### Step 2: Mixing
1. Place butter in a medium heatproof bowl, then add chopped chocolate.  
2. Microwave in 10-second increments, stirring after each, until smooth. Set aside.  
3. In a small bowl, whisk together:
   - ¼ cup flour  
   - ½ cup confectioners’ sugar  
   - ⅛ tsp salt  
4. In another small bowl, whisk together:
   - 2 large eggs  
   - 2 large egg yolks  
5. Pour both small bowls (flour mixture + egg mixture) into the melted chocolate.  
6. Stir gently with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon until smooth and slightly thick.  

### Step 3: Baking
1. Spoon batter evenly into ramekins or muffin cups (about 120–125g each).  
2. Place ramekins on a baking sheet and bake **12–14 minutes** until sides are firm and tops are soft.  
   *Muffin pan version:* bake 8–10 minutes.  
3. Internal temperature should reach **160°F** for safe eggs — check with an instant-read thermometer.  
4. Let cool for 1 minute, then invert onto plates (use an oven mitt).  
   *Muffin pan:* use a spoon to lift cakes out, then invert.  
5. Add toppings and serve immediately.

## 💡 Pro Tips

* **Make Ahead:** Prepare batter through Step 4, cover tightly, and refrigerate up to 2 days. Bring to room temp before baking.  
* **Freezing:** Fully baked cakes can be frozen up to 3 months; reheat in the microwave.  
* **Chocolate Tip:** Use real baking bars, not chips, for the best molten texture.  
* **Egg Safety:** Cakes are safe once internal temp hits 160°F.  

## 🍳 Cooking Notes

* Works great with 6-ounce ramekins or half a muffin pan (yields 6 cakes).  
* Best served warm with ice cream or berries.
