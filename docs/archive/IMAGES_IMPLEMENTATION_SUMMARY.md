1. Go to the home page
2. Click "Document favorite recipes" or "Share cooking tips"
3. Fill out the form
4. In the "Image URL" field, enter:
   - A web URL: `https://example.com/image.jpg`
   - A local path: `/images/recipes/my-dish.jpg`
5. Submit - the image will be included in the GitHub issue!

### Method 2: Direct File Editing
1. Save your image to `public/images/recipes/` (or `/tips/`)
2. Edit or create a recipe markdown file
3. Add the image field to frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "My Recipe"
   image: "/images/recipes/my-dish.jpg"
   ---
   ```
4. Commit and push changes

### Method 3: Using External URLs
Simply use any image URL from the web in the `image` field:
```markdown
---
title: "My Recipe"
image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xyz123"
---
```

## 📸 Where Images Appear

Images are automatically displayed in:
1. **Home page** - Recipe grid with image thumbnails
2. **All Recipes page** - Recipe cards with images
3. **Individual recipe pages** - Large hero image at the top
4. **GitHub issues** - Preview of submitted images

## 🎨 Image Best Practices

### Recommended Specs
- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics, WebP for best compression
- **Dimensions**: 1200x800px (16:9 or 4:3 ratio)
