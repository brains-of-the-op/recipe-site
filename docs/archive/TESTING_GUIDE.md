# üß™ Calendar Integration Testing Guide

This guide will help you test the calendar integration locally before creating a pull request.

## üöÄ Local Testing Setup

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:4321`

### 2. Test on Your Network (Optional)

To test on mobile devices on the same network:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```

This makes the site available at your local IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.x:4321`)

## üêõ Common Issues to Check

### **JavaScript Not Loading**
- **Symptom**: Buttons don't do anything when clicked
- **Check**: Console for "ReferenceError: addToGoogleCalendar is not defined"
- **Location**: `src/components/CalendarIntegration.astro`
- **Fix**: Ensure functions are attached to `window` object

### **Timeline Not Updating**
- **Symptom**: Times don't change when you pick a new date/time
- **Check**: Console for errors in `updateTimelinePreview`
- **Fix**: Ensure event listeners are attached properly

### **ICS File Empty or Corrupted**
- **Symptom**: Downloaded file doesn't open in calendar app
- **Check**: Open the `.ics` file in a text editor
- **Expected**: Should see `BEGIN:VCALENDAR` and `BEGIN:VEVENT`
- **Fix**: Check ICS generation in `downloadICSFile` function

### **Google Calendar Link Broken**
- **Symptom**: Opens Google Calendar but event is empty
- **Check**: URL encoding of title and description
- **Fix**: Ensure `encodeURIComponent` is used correctly

### **Times are Wrong**
- **Symptom**: Calendar events show different times than timeline
- **Check**: Timezone handling
- **Fix**: Verify `toISOString()` and timezone conversions

## üì∏ Visual Testing

### **Expected Layout**

The calendar integration section should appear:
1. **After the recipe content** (ingredients and instructions)
2. **Before the footer**
3. **Full width** within the container
4. **With a white background** and subtle border

### **Timeline Preview Should Show**

```
